Ecodrivers World
---------------------------------

INTRODUCTION TO THIS:
Community that I am developing as a project.
According to the Swedish schoolplan - I can do a project that has connection with
the education I am learning (I will get a grade for this). So, as I mostly have done computer and IT-oriented
courses, I choose to develop webapps with .NET and C# as project.
This is because I never have developed for the web, solely for the
Windows, with the .NET platform and C# language.

You can follow my work during my git commitments.

As I love ecodriving/hypermiling I always sought for a swedish community but yet haven't found any.
I think there must be some that is very familiar with this, and so I am just really trying to fil
in a gap here with this community.
